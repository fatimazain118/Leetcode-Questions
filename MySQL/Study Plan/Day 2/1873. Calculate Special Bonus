# Pattern matching using SQL simple regular expression comparison. Returns 1 (TRUE) or 0 (FALSE). If either expr or pat is NULL, the result is NULL.

#Case
Go through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met:
The CASE statement goes through conditions and return a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result.

If no conditions are true, it will return the value in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
