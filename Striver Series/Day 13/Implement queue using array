Output:

The element pushed is 4
The element pushed is 14
The element pushed is 24
The element pushed is 34
The peek of the queue before deleting any element 4
The size of the queue before deletion 4
The first element to be deleted 4
The peek of the queue after deleting an element 14
The size of the queue after deleting an element 3
