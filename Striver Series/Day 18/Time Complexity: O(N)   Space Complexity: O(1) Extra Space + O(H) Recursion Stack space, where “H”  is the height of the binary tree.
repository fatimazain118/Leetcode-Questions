Can be done by level order Traversal or Recursion both have there worst cases 

Recursion->when skewed
Level ->when last level is completely filled

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        
       int lh = maxDepth(root->left);
        int rh = maxDepth(root->right);
        
        return 1 + max(lh,rh);
    }
};

Time Complexity: O(N) 

Space Complexity: O(1) Extra Space + O(H) Recursion Stack space, where “H”  is the height of the binary tree.
