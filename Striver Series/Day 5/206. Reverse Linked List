Iterative

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* preptr = NULL;
        ListNode* currptr = head;
         
        while(currptr != NULL){
            ListNode* nextptr= currptr->next;
            
            currptr->next = preptr;  //reversing pointer
            preptr = currptr;
            currptr = nextptr;
            }
       return preptr;
     }
};

Time Complexity:

Since we are iterating only once through the list and achieving reversed list. Thus, the time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes present in the list.

Space Complexity:

To perform given tasks, no external spaces are used except three-pointers. So, space complexity is O(1).

Recursive
// Entire List will be pass to the recursive function, so just reverse the pointers of first two node

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* &head) {
       if(head == NULL or head->next == NULL){            //base case
           return head;
       }
        
        ListNode* n = reverseList(head->next);
        head->next->next = head;                  // reversing the pointer
        head->next = NULL;
        return n;                             // return the new headnode
     }
};

Time Complexity:

We move to the end of the list and achieve our reversed list. Thus, the time complexity is O(N) where N represents the number of nodes.

Space Complexity:

Apart from recursion using stack space, no external storage is used. Thus, space complexity is O(1).
