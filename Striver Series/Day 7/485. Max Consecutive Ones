Approach:  We maintain a variable count that keeps a track of the number of consecutive 1’s while traversing the array. The other variable max_count maintains the maximum 
number of 1’s, in other words, it maintains the answer.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxi = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            if(nums[i] == 1){
                count++;
            }
                else{
                    count = 0;
                }
            maxi = max(count, maxi);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};

Time Complexity: O(N) since the solution involves only a single pass.

Space Complexity: O(1) because no extra space is used.
